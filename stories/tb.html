It took a while for my memories to come back to me and I realized what happened before my coma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all started in 1997 when I was hanging out with my best friend Ralph and during that day, it was getting dark so Ralph went to his house and I walked home. I stop for a few seconds to look up at the sky. It looked like a dark void with a bunch of dust. Then I saw a giant rock heading towards me so I quickly dashed away from it and the rock barely missed me and I blacked out, and that&#39;s when the coma started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I woke up in 2004 and I didn&#39;t see anyone in the room where I am or the hallways, since the door was open. I manage to lift my upper half of my body off the bed but I couldn&#39;t move my legs. I looked around the room hopefully to find something, and there was a wheelchair at the other side of the room. I tried to move myself again, but I couldn&#39;t move an inch. I fell off the bed with my legs in pain and I slowly crawled to the wheelchair. I manage to lift myself off the ground to get in the wheelchair using the table next to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I left the room and I went to search for people to see where I am. I found an elevator and I went in and I pushed a random button hoping to take me somewhere and the floor of the elevator collapsed underneath me and I fell into a dark void and eventually found myself in a different place. The walls are a mono-yellow color with the smell of old moist carpet and the sounds of the fluorescent lights at max buzz. I wondered to myself &quot;Where the hell am I at now?&quot;. &nbsp;I started to move my wheelchair and I discovered that everywhere I turned it looked the same with some walls moving to different places. I wandered off from where I started and eventually found some writing on the wall that says, &quot;DO NOT MOVE! WHATEVER YOU DO, DON&#39;T MOVE!&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at it and laughed a bit and I heard a noise in the hall to my left and I quickly dashed to the right and I was being chased by this shadowy figure. I eventually found a hole in the ground and I really didn&#39;t want to go down but I had to before that figure got a hold of me, so I went down the hole and I dashed forward for a while to make sure that figure didn&#39;t catch up with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found a door so I opened it and I found a flight of stairs and an exit sign and I couldn&#39;t get this wheelchair to move up these stairs. I heard that figure so I quickly grabbed a hold of the railing on the wall and dragged me and the wheelchair up the stairs and blocked the door on the other side with a brick I found. I started to go forwards again and I found a window and I looked out and I saw an apartment like building outside, but I didn&#39;t see anything else but the building. It looked like a building inside of a building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I continued to move forward and I found another door, which leads to a lab of some sort. I heard the door slammed on the ground so I quickly hid in the lab, trying to stay quiet. I found a small cubbyhole in the lab so I hid in it and closed the door, which looked like a fake wall. I went further in the hole and heard the noise of glass breaking behind me. I eventually found another hole that looked like the outside world, like the view from the hospital. I turned around and that figure pushed me into the hole and I was falling out from the sky. Luckily I crashed into a pillow company so it was a soft landing beside the pain from my legs hitting the wheelchair. Some of the workers found me passed out on the pillows and the wheelchair on my legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was rushed into the hospital again, this time a smaller building. My mom rushed across from Florida to Oregon. My mom came into the hospital a few hours later and she was crying and angry at the same time because she thought I was at the hospital in Florida and they called my mom saying I was gone from the place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is now the year 2009 and I am able to walk on my legs again and I could actually talk. I told my mom what happened on the day I woke up on 2004. She was puzzled as wondering if it was a dream or not and how I ended up in a pillow factory on the other side of North America. I went to College to be a professor at Science. I was offered a job at this company called A-Sync and I got there and I realized that place I was at was not a dream after all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>

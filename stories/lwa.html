I usually ignore my suffering and continue on with my life. I&rsquo;ve been hurting for as long as I remember. Tragic events made it worse for me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapy didn&rsquo;t help at all. I was in therapy for about a couple of years before I stopped going. They don&rsquo;t care what you say, they always think you suffer from something. Most common thing is depression. They gave me depression medicine saying that this medicine will get rid of my depression. It only made it worse for me. That&rsquo;s the reason why I don&rsquo;t socialized anymore. I&rsquo;m afraid to even talk to people. I stayed quiet for a while, not saying a word. My wife left me so I was there by myself with no one.<br>I lose my motivation very easily. I don&rsquo;t do that much anymore. It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m lazy; it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t have the motivation I needed. There used to be family and friends to help me build up my motivation, but now, it feels like someone stabbed my back and left me there to rot.<br>I fell in to the endless void, calling out to my mother, my friends, my wife; no one was there to save me. I saw the light coming from a distance so I followed the light and there I was, in the hospital. <br>No one was there waiting for me. It was empty, empty as the void that swallowed me whole. I got up only to realize I couldn&rsquo;t move my legs, so I struggled to get to a wheelchair that was in the room. I went by multiple hallways and rooms until I got to the exit. I opened the doors only to see that no one was there, waiting for me. <br>I strolled across the deserted town and I eventually I found my home. I got inside the house to find my family. Nobody noticed me, so I started making noises and banging on the door, no one notices me. I went in front of them and started waving at them. Nothing happened. I looked around and I saw my picture hanging, on the wall of the dead people. <br>I started to panic and I couldn&rsquo;t hold on to my life support and I vanished into the void. My life ended too soon. I wasted my life. Nobody remembers me anymore. I bundled up and cried and cried wishing that I could be alive to see my family again, to see my wife and my children to grow up, but I&rsquo;ve wasted my life away. <br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>I kept on crying and crying until my mother confronted me. She picked me up on to her back, started humming a lullaby and carried me home. I was no longer sad. I felted loved. It was warm as a nice day in the spring, with the flowers blooming, the trees springing back to life. I fell asleep on my mom&rsquo;s back as she walked home. Happy memories, brings such joy to people. It felt like I was back home with my mother and my father from when I was a little child. Such great times I&rsquo;ve had.</span></p></body></html>
